   Base encoding of data is used in many situations to store or transfer
   data in environments that, perhaps for legacy reasons, are restricted
   to US-ASCII [<a href=3D"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#re=
f-1" title=3D"&quot;ASCII format for network interchange&quot;">1</a>] data=
.  Base encoding can also be used in new
   applications that do not have legacy restrictions, simply because it
   makes it possible to manipulate objects with text editors.

   In the past, different applications have had different requirements
   and thus sometimes implemented base encodings in slightly different
   ways.  Today, protocol specifications sometimes use base encodings in
   general, and "base64" in particular, without a precise description or
   reference.  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [<a href=3D"htt=
ps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#ref-4" title=3D"&quot;Multipurpo=
se Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bod=
ies&quot;">4</a>] is often
   used as a reference for base64 without considering the consequences
   for line-wrapping or non-alphabet characters.  The purpose of this
   specification is to establish common alphabet and encoding
   considerations.  This will hopefully reduce ambiguity in other
   documents, leading to better interoperability.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   Here we discuss the discrepancies between base encoding
   implementations in the past and, where appropriate, mandate a
   specific recommended behavior for the future.

tle=3D"&quot;Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format =
of Internet Message Bodies&quot;">4</a>] is often used as a reference for b=
ase 64 encoding.  However,
   MIME does not define "base 64" per se, but rather a "base 64 Content-
   Transfer-Encoding" for use within MIME.  As such, MIME enforces a
   limit on line length of base 64-encoded data to 76 characters.  MIME
   inherits the encoding from Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) [<a href=3D"https=
://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#ref-3" title=3D"&quot;Privacy Enha=
ncement for Internet Electronic Mail: Part I: Message Encryption and Authen=
tication Procedures&quot;">3</a>], stating
   that it is "virtually identical"; however, PEM uses a line length of
   64 characters.  The MIME and PEM limits are both due to limits within
   SMTP.

   Implementations MUST NOT add line feeds to base-encoded data unless
   the specification referring to this document explicitly directs base
   encoders to add line feeds after a specific number of characters.

coded Data</span>

   In some circumstances, the use of padding ("=3D") in base-encoded data
   is not required or used.  In the general case, when assumptions about
   the size of transported data cannot be made, padding is required to
   yield correct decoded data.

   Implementations MUST include appropriate pad characters at the end of
   encoded data unless the specification referring to this document
   explicitly states otherwise.

   The base64 and base32 alphabets use padding, as described below in
   sections <a href=3D"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#sectio=
n-4">4</a> and <a href=3D"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#sec=
tion-6">6</a>, but the base16 alphabet does not need it; see
   <a href=3D"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-8">sect=
ion 8</a>.

<span class=3D"h3"><a class=3D"selflink" id=3D"section-3.3" href=3D"https:/=
/datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Interpretatio=
n of Non-Alphabet Characters in Encoded Data</span>

   Base encodings use a specific, reduced alphabet to encode binary
   data.  Non-alphabet characters could exist within base-encoded data,
   caused by data corruption or by design.  Non-alphabet characters may
   be exploited as a "covert channel", where non-protocol data can be
   sent for nefarious purposes.  Non-alphabet characters might also be
   sent in order to exploit implementation errors leading to, e.g.,
   buffer overflow attacks.

   Implementations MUST reject the encoded data if it contains
   characters outside the base alphabet when interpreting base-encoded
   data, unless the specification referring to this document explicitly
   states otherwise.  Such specifications may instead state, as MIME
   does, that characters outside the base encoding alphabet should
   simply be ignored when interpreting data ("be liberal in what you
   accept").  Note that this means that any adjacent carriage return/
   line feed (CRLF) characters constitute "non-alphabet characters" and
   are ignored.  Furthermore, such specifications MAY ignore the pad
   character, "=3D", treating it as non-alphabet data, if it is present
   before the end of the encoded data.  If more than the allowed number
   of pad characters is found at the end of the string (e.g., a base 64
   string terminated with "=3D=3D=3D"), the excess pad characters MAY also =
be
   ignored.

/datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-3.4">3.4</a>.  Choosing the =
Alphabet</span>

   Different applications have different requirements on the characters
   in the alphabet.  Here are a few requirements that determine which
   alphabet should be used:






<span class=3D"grey">Josefsson                   Standards Track           =
          [Page 4]</span></pre>

   o  Handled by humans.  The characters "0" and "O" are easily
      confused, as are "1", "l", and "I".  In the base32 alphabet below,
      where 0 (zero) and 1 (one) are not present, a decoder may
      interpret 0 as O, and 1 as I or L depending on case.  (However, by
      default it should not; see previous section.)

   o  Encoded into structures that mandate other requirements.  For base
      16 and base 32, this determines the use of upper- or lowercase
      alphabets.  For base 64, the non-alphanumeric characters (in

   The padding step in base 64 and base 32 encoding can, if improperly
   implemented, lead to non-significant alterations of the encoded data.
   For example, if the input is only one octet for a base 64 encoding,
   then all six bits of the first symbol are used, but only the first
   two bits of the next symbol are used.  These pad bits MUST be set to
   zero by conforming encoders, which is described in the descriptions
   on padding below.  If this property do not hold, there is no
   canonical representation of base-encoded data, and multiple base-
   encoded strings can be decoded to the same binary data.  If this
   property (and others discussed in this document) holds, a canonical
   encoding is guaranteed.

   In some environments, the alteration is critical and therefore
   decoders MAY chose to reject an encoding if the pad bits have not
   been set to zero.  The specification referring to this may mandate a
   specific behaviour.

   A 65-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
   represented per printable character.  (The extra 65th character, "=3D",
   is used to signify a special processing function.)

   The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output
   strings of 4 encoded characters.  Proceeding from left to right, a
   24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8-bit input groups.
   These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit groups, each
   of which is translated into a single character in the base 64
   alphabet.

   Each 6-bit group is used as an index into an array of 64 printable
   characters.  The character referenced by the index is placed in the
   output string.

   Special processing is performed if fewer than 24 bits are available
   at the end of the data being encoded.  A full encoding quantum is
   always completed at the end of a quantity.  When fewer than 24 input
   bits are available in an input group, bits with value zero are added
   (on the right) to form an integral number of 6-bit groups.  Padding
   at the end of the data is performed using the '=3D' character.  Since
   all base 64 input is an integral number of octets, only the following
   cases can arise:

   (1) The final quantum of encoding input is an integral multiple of 24
       bits; here, the final unit of encoded output will be an integral
       multiple of 4 characters with no "=3D" padding.

   The Base 64 encoding with an URL and filename safe alphabet has been
   used in [<a href=3D"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#ref-12=
" title=3D"&quot;Post to P2P-hackers mailing list&quot;">12</a>].

   An alternative alphabet has been suggested that would use "~" as the
   63rd character.  Since the "~" character has special meaning in some
   file system environments, the encoding described in this section is
   recommended instead.  The remaining unreserved URI character is ".",
   but some file system environments do not permit multiple "." in a
   filename, thus making the "." character unattractive as well.

   The pad character "=3D" is typically percent-encoded when used in an
   URI [<a href=3D"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#ref-9" tit=
le=3D"&quot;Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax&quot;">9</a>]=
, but if the data length is known implicitly, this can be
   avoided by skipping the padding; see <a href=3D"https://datatracker.ietf=
.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-3.2">section 3.2</a>.

   This encoding may be referred to as "base64url".  This encoding
   should not be regarded as the same as the "base64" encoding and
   should not be referred to as only "base64".  Unless clarified
   otherwise, "base64" refers to the base 64 in the previous section.

   This encoding is technically identical to the previous one, except
   for the 62:nd and 63:rd alphabet character, as indicated in Table 2.

   The following description is original but analogous to previous
   descriptions.  Essentially, Base 16 encoding is the standard case-
   insensitive hex encoding and may be referred to as "base16" or "hex".

   A 16-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 4 bits to be
   represented per printable character.

   The encoding process represents 8-bit groups (octets) of input bits
   as output strings of 2 encoded characters.  Proceeding from left to
   right, an 8-bit input is taken from the input data.  These 8 bits are
   then treated as 2 concatenated 4-bit groups, each of which is
   translated into a single character in the base 16 alphabet.

   Each 4-bit group is used as an index into an array of 16 printable
   characters.  The character referenced by the index is placed in the
   output string.

   To translate between binary and a base encoding, the input is stored

   An ISO C99 implementation of Base64 encoding and decoding that is
   believed to follow all recommendations in this RFC is available from:

      <a href=3D"https://josefsson.org/base-encoding/">http://josefsson.org=
/base-encoding/</a>

   This code is not normative.

   The code could not be included in this RFC for procedural reasons
   (<a href=3D"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3978#section-5.4">R=
FC 3978 section&nbsp;5.4</a>).

<span class=3D"h2"><a class=3D"selflink" id=3D"section-12" href=3D"https://=
datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-12">12</a>.  Security Conside=
rations</span>

   When base encoding and decoding is implemented, care should be taken
   not to introduce vulnerabilities to buffer overflow attacks, or other
   attacks on the implementation.  A decoder should not break on invalid
   input including, e.g., embedded NUL characters (ASCII 0).

   If non-alphabet characters are ignored, instead of causing rejection
   of the entire encoding (as recommended), a covert channel that can be
   used to "leak" information is made possible.  The ignored characters
   could also be used for other nefarious purposes, such as to avoid a
   string equality comparison or to trigger implementation bugs.  The
   implications of ignoring non-alphabet characters should be understood
   in applications that do not follow the recommended practice.
   Similarly, when the base 16 and base 32 alphabets are handled case
   insensitively, alteration of case can be used to leak information or
   make string equality comparisons fail.

   When padding is used, there are some non-significant bits that
   warrant security concerns, as they may be abused to leak information
   or used to bypass string equality comparisons or to trigger
   implementation problems.

   Base encoding visually hides otherwise easily recognized information,
   such as passwords, but does not provide any computational
   confidentiality.  This has been known to cause security incidents
   when, e.g., a user reports details of a network protocol exchange
   (perhaps to illustrate some other problem) and accidentally reveals
   the password because she is unaware that the base encoding does not
   protect the password.

   Base encoding adds no entropy to the plaintext, but it does increase
   the amount of plaintext available and provide a signature for
   cryptanalysis in the form of a characteristic probability
   distribution.
